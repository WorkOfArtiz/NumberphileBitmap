# Things to do in 4d etc. plot

So as usual I was wasting my time watching online videos when suddenly D:

`A wild mystery appeared`

During one of the videos [here](https://youtu.be/_s5RFgd59ao) Matt explains that
there's an easter egg in his book. A small image is hidden in a number.

Naturally this became a thing at 12 o'clock in the night since I didn't feel
like doing anything else.

Here is the result, the hidden image (in green and black because of [reasons](https://twitter.com/jnunemaker/status/562629640398057472))

## Script

I've included the poorly coded script, no judgements. I was tired and wrote it in 10 minutes. With the wrong number thanks to [this person](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9wluqf7cI8jLmI0XhzxyQ) :(

Props to [Ben Farrant](https://www.youtube.com/user/6002fneb) for copy pasting correctly
